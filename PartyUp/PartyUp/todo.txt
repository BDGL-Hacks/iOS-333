TODO
====

 - Change Storyboard to use a dropdown menu for Navigation instead of tab / nav bar
 - Fix 'User is not logged in' error when user is clearly logged in
 - Have views display properly on bigger and smaller devices

 - Make database calls asynchronous (you can still do stuff while its happenning)
 - Have PartyUpTableCell display '...' when any text is too long
 - Fix textShouldReturn
 - Buttons in names in the search bar

Globals / DataManager
---------------------
 ! When backend has groups return time parameter, delete time check in getGroupDayText(), etc.
 - Actually implement specified data extraction and formatting methods in DataManager
 - Change getEventGroup in DataManager to actually get the group the user is going to the event with

Homepage
--------
 - Find better way homepage not perform queries on startup if not logged in -> go straight to login
 - Logout confirmation popover so can't logout with one click

Groups Main Page
----------------

Groups Advanced Page

Group Info Page
---------------
 ! Create it!

Group Chat
----------
 ! Fix Pusher new message notifications (it doesn't detect new messages on the channel)

 - Get next 10 messages when user scrolls to top of the page

Create Groups
-------------
 - Perform form validation: specifically, don't even query backend if a group hasn't been selected
 - Allow user to add an event to a group (takes to alternative event creation page)
    - update group events afterwards
 - Create a group from within an event
    - populate table to choose from with the event attendees
 - Add an event to an already-existing group (no API call to do this yet - could destroy and recreate
   group but would need all of the other events of that group)

Events (General)
----------------
 - Figure out why / if event pages automatically re-query for data
 - Change tab icons and labels

Event Tables
------------
 - Have table cell font decrease or show (...) if text is too long
 - Improve table and custom cell aesthetics

My Events

 ! Implement invitations
 - For 'Events you're invited to' create invitation response popover
 - Put '--' or some other placeholder text when there are no events in a given table.
 - Have attending event table cell subtext display group instead of location and time

Find Events
-----------
 - Add searching by time
 - Have live searching query the database for updated data each time

Event Info
----------
 - Improve attendee table aesthetics
 - Remove huge vertical space under attendee table
 - Display whether the event is public or private and invited list if private?
 - Toggle-able button to accept the invitation (only if it's an invited event)

Create Event
------------
 - investigate popover presentation
 - put code from add friends button inside redo search X
 - get rid of David in search (for historical reasons) X
 - smaller date picker
 - reload query results when user scrolls
 - Put top buttons inside a Navigation Bar
 - don't display users that are already added (still broken)

Alerts Page
-----------
 ! Write backend query code to handle accepting / rejecting invitations
   - Incorporate corresponding code in AlertsModel accept / rejectButtonPressed
 ! Handle check up alerts in AlertModel and PartyUpBackend
 - Implement Group Info segues and TODOs in AlertViewController

Login
-----
 - Have view scroll down slightly when keyboard is displayed

Register
--------
 - Have view scroll down when keyboard is displayed (such that all fields and register button is still displayed)
 - Make "Back to Login" button placement more consistent with Login's "Register for PartyUp" button

Backend (Not us!)
-----------------
 ! Groups: Should have a time field (of first event)
 ! Messages: Method that returns all messages after a certain message id
 - Events: Repopulate database with events that have non-null descriptions
 - Events: Also send back the group the user is going to the event with
