TODO
====

General
-------
 - Make NSLog not print out everything under the sun before its message

(Homepage)
----------
 - Check for authentication => redirect to Homepage if necessary

Login
-----
 - Fix and throughly test login with backend
 - Perform form validation
 - Save authentication in NSUserDefaultPrefs and transition to Homepage
 - Save authentication cookie (NSHTTPCookieStorage)
 - Automatically redirect to Homepage if the user is logged in (so Registration can cleanly transition to Homepage)
 - Have view scroll down slightly when keyboard is displayed

Register
--------
 - Perform form validation
 - Automatically login new user upon successful registration -> go straight to home page
 - Have view scroll down when keyboard is displayed (such that all fields and register button is still displayed)
 - Make "Back to Login" button placement more consistent with Login's '"Register for PartyUp" button

Backend (Not us!)
-----------------
 - Have error message for register and login be more useful (an alert saying MISSING INFO is hardly professional)
