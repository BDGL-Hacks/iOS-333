TODO
====

General
-------
 - Make NSLog not print out everything under the sun before its message
 - Write some tests for Login and Register

(Homepage)
----------
 - Check for authentication => redirect to Homepage if necessary
 - Have Logout button actually log you out and delete authentication cookie

Login
-----
 - Save authentication in NSUserDefaultPrefs and transition to Homepage
 - Automatically redirect to Homepage if the user is logged in (so Registration can cleanly transition to Homepage)
 - Have view scroll down slightly when keyboard is displayed

Register
--------
 - Automatically login new user upon successful registration -> go straight to home page
 - Have view scroll down when keyboard is displayed (such that all fields and register button is still displayed)
 - Make "Back to Login" button placement more consistent with Login's '"Register for PartyUp" button

Backend (Not us!)
-----------------
 - Server does not appear to accept unicode characters (at least not registration)
